This dataset contains information about the fuel efficiency and various features of a vehicle. Below is a description of each **feature** (column) and its practical significance:

---

### 1. **city_mpg**
- **Function**: Indicates the number of miles per gallon (MPG) on city roads.
- **Usage**: Used in urban fuel economy analysis.

### 2. **class**
- **Function**: Indicates the type or class of vehicle (e.g. `midsize car`, `SUV`, `two seater`).
- **Usage**: Useful for class-based comparisons or market segmentation.

### 3. **combination_mpg**
- **Function**: The combined average of city and highway MPG.
- **Usage**: Used in assessing overall fuel efficiency.

### 4. **cylinders**
- **Function**: Number of cylinders in the engine.
- **Usage**: Used in analysis related to engine power and power.

### 5. **displacement**
- **Work**: Engine displacement (in liters).
- **Usage**: Related to engine size and efficiency.

### 6. **drive**
- **Work**: Drivetrain type (e.g. `fwd`, `rwd`, `awd`, `4wd`).
- **Usage**: In analyzing vehicle drivability, traction, and fuel economy.

### 7. **fuel_type**
- **Work**: Fuel type (e.g. `gas`, `diesel`, `electricity`).
- **Usage**: In analyzing fuel policy or environmental impact.

### 8. **highway_mpg**
- **Work**: Highway miles per gallon.
- **Usage**: In determining long-distance fuel economy.

### 9. **make**
- **Function**: Car manufacturer (e.g.: `Toyota`, `BMW`).
- **Usage**: In brand-based comparison or market share analysis.

### 10. **model**
- **Function**: Car model name.
- **Usage**: In specific model-based analysis or evaluation.

### 11. **transmission**
- **Function**: Transmission type (e.g.: `a` = automatic, `m` = manual).
- **Usage**: In fuel efficiency or driving experience analysis.

### 12. **year**
- **Function**: Car model year.
- **Usage**: In technological development or fuel efficiency trends over time.
